# Overview
It's been a decade since Bitcoin with its underlying computing model, the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model, brought the most prominent application of blockchain technology to life - decentralized financial systems. 
This seminal pioneer breakthrough inspired subsequent revolutions reimagining decentralized socio-economic systems. A second wave introduced smart contracts, which allows to put conditions on financial transactions written in verifiable code which then paves the path for decentralized applications (dApps) to emerge; and a third wave introduced self-governing mechanisms embedded in the system. Nowadays a competitive blockchain must offer a network protocol that meets all previous advancements plus have its roadmap heavily focused on maximizing the decentralization-security-scalability triad (aka. Blockchain trilemma) from research to tech-engineering.

## Goals
1. This [handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L4eQSjC5SLY8iDSca1FJRrNy1Dwhr2aJ3I1Y-LhpTUk/edit?usp=sharing) aims to be a presentation card of all the different chain designs of UTXO Alliance members. Aiming to be a handy resource for entrepreneurs, commercial partners and a general audience with minimal technical knowledge.
2. Explain the key aspects of the UTXO model and the functioning of a blockchain using simple visual flowcharts. 
3. Expose the rich variety of the different designs implemented by various blockchains that are part of the UTXO Alliance.
